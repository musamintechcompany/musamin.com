I have long startd this project for months now, though this is not the only project i have created. I have done many others and it worked and some others failed. For this project i have done otherss which i used for testing but i deleted some of the project file because it was taking some space. This is not the first musamin project i am creating, this is basically the 3rd version, the very first version and second one wasn't published to the public because of some features that wasn't added then, but this was published because it went well.

I installed ramsey uuid in my project, with this command (composer require ramsey/uuid)

I installed vinkla/hashids in my project with this command (composer require vinkla/hashids), and after i talled it, i ran this command for publishing it config file (php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Vinkla\Hashids\HashidsServiceProvider")

I installed laravel reverb. I went to the laravel documentation page and then went to the broadcast part and user the broadcast command which i then choose reverb in my terminal while i ran the command. after that i also choose 'yes' for the node dependencies to be installed to and for vite to compile the files, and it was installed successfully.
